# Hanzo ZT Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Introduction and Purpose
The Hanzo ZT project is an open source project sponsored by NetFoundry Inc.  The purpose of the project is to provide a high quality secure and programmable network overlay on any IP infrastructure, enabling zero trust architectures.  As the project is focused on protecting data in transit and any nodes providing or consuming this information, security is of the utmost importance.  To encourage a more secure project and world in general, this Safe Harbor Policy grants developers, researchers, and others legal safe harbor for the research and reporting of security issues and vulnerabilities within the project.
    
### Scope and eligibility
This policy is applicable to all the code within the Hanzo ZT project, and anyone is eligible to research and/or submit vulnerability information without fear of legal reprisal.  
    
This policy does not allow for the penetration testing or attempted exploitation of deployed network instances not owned and operated by the tester, unless specifically authorized.  Any research or testing of deployed systems must be conducted under the terms and conditions of the owner of that system.  

Archived repostiories of the hanzozt organziation are not maintained, and vulnerabilities within those repositories will not be addressed.
    
### Responsible Disclosure Guidelines
Issues that are not sensitive in nature, being defined as issues that can reasonably be expected to expose current systems to information risk, should be reported using the issues process in the appropriate repository.
    
Issues that are sensitive in nature should be reported to security@hanzozt.org to maintain privacy while the issue is investigated and mitigated if necessary.
    
When reporting an issue, please be as descriptive as possible, preferably laying out the environment (operating system, version, etc.) and the steps to recreate the exploitation.  Any steps known or believed to remediate the issue are appreciated, to improve the time to mitigation.
    
After contact, reporters should receive a response within 7 days.  Anonymous reports will be accepted, however, there is a strong preference for some communication channel with the reporter for clarifications and/or discussion about the report.
    
Release of a CVE or advisory will depend on the details of the finding, and will be coordinated with the release of the fixed version(s) if appropriate.  Please see the product security incident response process for more information.  
    
### Legal Protection and Immunity
The Hanzo ZT project, and its primary sponsor, NetFoundry, will not pursue legal actions against researchers or other reporters for good faith efforts to research and report vulnerabilities in the software.  The project encourages these actions so that Hanzo ZT can continue to improve and provide the best security possible.
    
### Attribution and Acknowledgement
Security issues reported and found to be impactful will be attributed to the reporter in any disclosures made by Hanzo ZT and/or NetFoundry, including announcements, reports, and release notes including the mitigations.
    
Hanzo ZT appreciates the efforts of researchers and other community members in providing assistance improving the security of the project, and the information protected by its users.
